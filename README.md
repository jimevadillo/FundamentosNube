## docker-compose.yml
It is a yml extension file where we can define the container _version_, _services_, _volumes_, among others. The top level props that compose the file in this project are the following:  
- version: Indicates the format version of the docker compose file. In terms of compability, we can use an specific format version but its recommended to use the lastest version.
- services: Indicates the resources of the container, we can specify what services our container will use. in this top level props we can find: 
  - image: Defines the docker image that wil manage the container, we can specify the version of the image if there is more than one.
  - restart: Defines the behavior of the container when it stops.
  - environment: Define the values of the environment variables. Each docker image cn have different variables.
  - ports: Defines in which port the container will run.
  - volumes: Defines the folder management implemented by the host.

Why every level have line breaks with each other?. This is because of the best indent practices.
